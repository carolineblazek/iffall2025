        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <b><li>Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</li></b>
            <p>Caroline Blazek, ComDes and Art History, junior</p>
            <b><li>Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li></b>
            <p>I am interested in the illustration path of ComDes, so I'm not very experienced in coding but I do understand how these skills are helpful.</p>
            <b><li>Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li></b>
            <p>I have very little experience with HTML. We did a small activity using HTML in my Typography class last semester, but it was a very basic translation of a chapbook into a digital format.</p>
            <b><li>Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li></b>
            <p>I hope to learn how to create an aesthetically attractive site while maintaining efficiency and functionality.</p>
            <b><li>Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li></b>
            <p>I understand from experience creating website graphics that visuals for the screen must be scaled and organized very differently compared to printed media.</p>
            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effecive design. Explain your choice.</li></b>
            <p> I think the website for <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/?ref=logo"> Urban Outfitters</a> exemplifies effective design, as the various categories and advertisements are organized in an eye-catching, yet not overwhelming manner </p>
            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li></b>
             <p> I think the website for <a href="https://www.etsy.com/?ref=lgo"> Etsy</a> exemplifies effective communication, as product categories are easy to navigate and the website possesses an overall clean, simple appearance. </p>
            <b><li>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li></b>
            <p> I think the website for <a href=https://www.formula1.com/> Formula One</a> works well, as the website balances many elements of information for the sport, such as news, schedule, statistics, in a condensed manner. The user can easily navigate the website to find various areas of information without being overloaded upon opening the site. </p>
