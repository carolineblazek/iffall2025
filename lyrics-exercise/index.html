        <h3>[Verse 1]</h3>
        <p>Just as you take my hand</p>
        <p>Just as you write my number down</p>
        <p>Just as the drinks arrive</p>
        <p>Just as they play your favourite song</p>
        <p>As your bad day disappears</p>
        <p>No longer wound up like a spring</p>
        <p>Before you've had too much</p>
        <p>Come back in focus again</p>
        <p>The walls are bending shape</p>
        <p>They've got a Cheshire cat grin</p>
        <p>All blurring into one</p>
        <p>This place is on a mission</p>
        <p>Before the night owl</p>
        <p>Before the animal noises</p>
        <p>Closed circuit cameras</p>
        <p>Before you're comatose</p>

        <h3>[Verse 2]</h3>
        <p>Before you run away from me</p>
        <p>Before you're lost between the notes</p>
        <p>The beat goes 'round and 'round</p>
        <p>The beat goes 'round and 'round</p>
        <p>I never really got there</p>
        <p>I just pretended that I had</p>
        <p>Words are blunt instruments</p>
        <p>Words are sawn-off shotguns</p>
        <p>Come on and let it out</p>
        <p>Come on and let it out</p>
        <p>Come on and let it out</p>
        <p>Come on and let it out</p>
        <p>Before you run away from me</p>
        <p>Before you're lost between the notes</p>
        <p>Just as you take the mic</p>
        <p>Just as you dance, dance, dance</p>

        <h3>[Chorus]</h3>
        <p>A jigsaw falling into place</p>
        <p>So there is nothing to explain</p>
        <p>You eye each other as you pass</p>
        <p>She looks back, and you look back</p>
        <p>Not just once, and not just twice</p>
        <p>Wish away your nightmare</p>
        <p>Wish away the nightmare</p>
        <p>You got the light, you can feel it on your back</p>
        <p>A light, you can feel it on your back</p>
        <p>Your jigsaw falling into place</p>
        <br><br><br><br>
